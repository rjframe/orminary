# Orminary

ORM for D inspired by (but not really based on) SqlAchemy.

I'm currently working on a DB-independent expression language. If your project
uses a database engine not officially supported, you will be able to create and
use your own engine.

I plan to support SqLite, MySQL, Postgres, and possibly MS SQL Server. My goal
is to support at least all DMD compilers (final patch versions) released within
the past  year.

## Work in Progress

Nothing here is ready; if you're looking for a current ORM solution, take a look at:

- [Diamond MVC](http://diamondmvc.org/)
- [Hibernated](http://code.dlang.org/packages/hibernated)
- [Hunt-entity](http://code.dlang.org/packages/hunt-entity)
